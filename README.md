###### The code in it's current state does not show any presentations and I do not know why.

Changelog was added after making changes, which is why some changes might not be mentioned and some might be simplified because I don't remember exactly what I did.
## Changelog:

1. Removed unused variables from all classes
2. Removed unused methods from all classes
3. Reworked switch statement for controls because there were many switches that could have been one switch
4. Refactored the accessor class to use a reader and writer.
5. Made adjustments to JabberPoint.java so it would use the new factory methods.
6. Made adjustments to MenuController so it would use the new factory methods
